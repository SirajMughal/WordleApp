- [✅] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**

To display the 'correctness' of a guess:
'O' represents the right letter in the right place
'+' represents the right letter in the wrong place
'X' represents a letter not in the target word
For example, if the target word is "STAR", and the user guessed 'SAIL', the string generated would be "O+XX".
